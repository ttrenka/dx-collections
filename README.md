# Collections
This package is a port of dojox.collections, to truly anonymous AMD.  As such, it has no
dependencies outside of itself.

Collections contains a number of classes with which one can perform more advanced Array-type
operations with; it includes ArrayList, BinaryTree, Dictionary, Queue, SortedList and Stack
constructors, as well as a singleton (Set) which can be used for basic set operations on a
pair of arrays (internally converted to ArrayList objects).
